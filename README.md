# Random Ideas
Personal random but public idea repo. Inspired by other idea repos (0xngmi,
Divide-By-0). Feel free to be inspired by or straight up take ideas for
yourself. Credit is appreciated but not strictly necessary. No guarantess that
these ideas are good or original, just that I either came up with them
independently or forgot the place / resource that inspired.

## Ideas
- **Removing OFAC censorship from flashbots:** Fork mev-boost to a version that
  allows for multi-block MEV. If validators earn more rewards with "mmev-boost" than mev-boost 
  and the default relayer has no censorship they'll hopefully switch to it over time, decreasing censorship on the network.
- **Time based AMM (definitely not original):** Allow for gas efficient DCA and
  large order splitting while massively increasing the cost of TWAP manipulation
  by requiring attackers to take on cost of price offset during manipulation.
  (other resources: [TWAMM - Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm),
  [Mean Finance](https://mean.finance/create) unsure if MMEV resistant tho)
- **Crypto Splitwise:** Expense splitting app like Splitwise that allows for
  easy accounting and splitting of expenses in groups except it also allows you
  to easily settle debts, especially useful for larger groups
